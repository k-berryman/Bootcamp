# Giphy Party

The application does the following:
-   Allows the user to search for a GIF and when the form is submitted, make an AJAX request to the Giphy API and return a single GIF
-   Once the Giphy API has responded with data, append the GIF to the page
-   Allow the user to search for as many GIFs as they would like and keep appending them to the page
-   Allow the user to remove all of the GIFs by clicking a button

----
The API - https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/
A sample request - `axios.get(http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=puppies.value&api_key=myAPIKey)`
