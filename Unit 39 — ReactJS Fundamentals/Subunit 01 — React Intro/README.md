# React Intro
This subunit taught by Springboard / Colt Steele focuses on React basics, components & JSX. Notes by Kaitlin Berryman.

## Front-end Frameworks
Frameworks are larger / "heavier" than libraries. They make creating client-side apps easier. React actually describes itself as a library. They provide a "blueprint" and are "opinionated", meaning they show you the "right" way/their way to build an app. Various frameworks have different levels of control. Good for templates & code re-use. Think of social media templates.. there's different content, but it's all formatted the same. We value modularity & readability! Frameworks make development faster & easier. Dynamic client-side stuff so the page doesn't have to refresh. Others include Angular, Vue, and Svelte.

## Why React?
It's widely used. React is light-weight in comparison to the other options. React gives you more freedom & flexibility. Colt thinks that it's also easier to learn. Smaller amount of overhead to remember. This can be a pro or a con. This is kinda like the Flask vs Django debate. React is less controlling, for better or worse.
Fun fact - it's developed by Facebook

## React Components
React's main goal is modularity through reusable components. Components can have JS, HTML, CSS all grouped together. Back to the social media example.. think of a post component or a comment component. Same structure repeated over & over.
